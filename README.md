## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these instructions to run the project locally on your machine.

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd py-project
```

**2. Set up a virtual environment (Recommended)**
Isolating dependencies ensures no conflicts with system packages.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Initialize the database**
This script will recreate `food_ordering.db` and insert initial data schemas along with a default admin account.
```bash
python setup_db.py
```

**5. Start the Flask server**
```bash
python app.py
```

**6. Access the application**
Open your preferred modern web browser and navigate to:
```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## ⚠️ Important Deployment Notes
- **Admin Access:** The default admin credentials generated by `setup_db.py` are Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`.
- **Environment Safety:** Keep `.env` files, `.venv`, and `food_ordering.db` outside of version control (as configured in `.gitignore`).
- **Production Mode:** Before deploying to a live web server (like PythonAnywhere, Heroku, or AWS), edit `app.py` or use environment variables to change the `app.secret_key` to a strong, randomized cryptographic string.
